## 🌟 About Me

I’m a 16-year-old (turning 17) from Pakistan, currently living in Lahore.

I like to describe myself as a mix of a **lazy genius and a hard worker**, depending on how interesting the problem is.

I'm passionate about:
- 💻 Programming & Game Development  
- 🔐 Cybersecurity  
- 🤖 AI/ML  
- 🧮 Mathematics

I love breaking things apart to understand how they work — whether it’s code, systems, or everyday gadgets.

Most of my projects are experimental builds, personal tools, or scripts made for exploration and learning.

I’m also highly active on **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)** and have reached the **Candidate Master** level (1900+), reflecting advanced problem-solving and algorithmic skills.
